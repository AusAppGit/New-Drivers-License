# New-Drivers-License
A code response to Sololearn's Code Coach Challenge titled, "New Driver's License".
The code should take a name as input, then calculate how long you'll need to wait
based on the amount of workers and clients before you (in alphabetical order).  It 
takes a worker 20 minutes to process a license.
Input is a string which is your name, an integer for the amount of staff on shift, and a string
of four names of the other clients in the waiting room. Output is an integer representing
the waiting time in minutes.
